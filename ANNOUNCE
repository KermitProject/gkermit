The Original G-Kermit 1.00 announcement follows.  Version 2.00 of 26 May 2021
and 2.01 0f 15 November 2021 are functionally identical but have been adjusted
to compile and link successfully on modern Unix platforms such as Ubuntu 20.04,
Red Hat EL6, NetBSD 9.2, and macOS 10.15.7 with Xcode 12.4.

This to announce a new, compact, and GPL'd Kermit program for UNIX.  The
new program is called G-Kermit (GNU Kermit).  It is intended to meet the
need for a Kermit protocol implementation that is:

 . Stable and low-maintenance
 . Compact and fast with no frills
 . Under the GNU Public License

G-Kermit is command-line only (no interactive commands or scripting) and
remote-mode only (no making connections).  It has an extremely simple user
interface, and implements a large subset of the Kermit protocol in a small
amount of highly portable code.

It has been built and tested on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, ranging
from early-1980s to up-to-the-minute, using both traditional C and ANSI C.
It is designed to be as independent as possible of platform-specific
features, and therefore to be stable for many years if we resist the
temptation to add features to it.  The size of the binary ranges from 33K
(on HP-UX 8.00) to 104K on Ultrix/MIPS, with an average size of 53K over 64
builds, and a typical size of 37K on PC-based UNIXes.

It's easy to build, install, and uninstall.  It requires no privileges.
Documentation is included as a plain-text README file and a man page.

You can find G-Kermit 1.00 on the Web at:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/gkermit.html

and by FTP at:

  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/archives/gkermit.tar.Z  (88K)
  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/archives/gkermit.tar.gz (62K)
  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/bin/gku100.* (individual binaries)

Uncompress, untar, read the README file, and take it from there (in most
cases you just type "make" to build it).

Send test reports to kermit-support@columbia.edu.
